# practice of writing 

Nowadays, many young children may just enjoy the convenience of Internet which may mislead some of them to generate the idea that it's more important to improve the Internet access than to improve the public transportation. However, such opinion suffer from both logical and factual fallacies. And such opinion should be checked meticulously. As far as helping poor family and improve the whole society working efficiency, I strongly hold the opposite opinion that improving the public transportation matters more.

4min: 70 words:



Indeed, a voice rise that the Internet can also improve the society working efficiency, because that nowadays many IT companies take the use of Internet to start working. However, it can be not denied that not all companies are using the net work. After all, for most of companies, a more convenience transport system means more, which can reduce the economy pressure and save more time.

We must have a precise grasp of historical trends, stand firm in our ideals and convictions, and stay true to our Party’s founding mission. We must remain modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and rashness, and work hard. We must not be intimidated by any risks or led astray by any distractions, and we must be absolutely certain that we make no catastrophic mistakes on fundamental issues. With the determination to never let up until we reach our goals and the attitude that the last leg of the journey marks the halfway point only, we must make unremitting efforts to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

It was unanimously agreed that the external environment has grown increasingly complex and grave over the past year under the combined impact of worldwide changes of a scale unseen in a century and the global coronavirus pandemic, while China has faced extremely arduous tasks in COVID-19 prevention and control as well as economic and social development at home.

The Political Bureau has given full consideration to both domestic and international imperatives, coordinated the COVID-19 response with economic and social development, and placed equal emphasis on development and security. It has continued to follow the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, fully applied the new development philosophy, and accelerated efforts to foster a new pattern of development. The economy has maintained good momentum, positive advances have been made in building up China’s scientific and technological self-reliance, and further progress has been achieved in reform and opening up. A complete victory has been secured in the fight against poverty as scheduled, the people’s wellbeing has been further improved, social stability has been maintained, steady progress was made in modernizing national defense and the armed forces, and China’s major-country diplomacy has advanced on all fronts. The campaign on studying the Party’s history has produced solid results, and severe natural disasters of multiple categories have been dealt with effectively. Through these efforts, signiﬁcant progress has been made in all areas of the Party and country’s endeavors.

  develop a critical thinking towards news.

Nowadays, with an increasingly easy access to diverse information on the Internet, people could more effortlessly collect relevant data to make informed decision when encountering previously seemingly unsurmountable difficulties

the information people received has been processed or even manipulated, causing information deemed to be insignificant by news agencies to be neglected

people could be more critical towards opinions presented by news and maintain an objective perception even after starting reading news again.

*speak*:
people could pay more attention to (news) itself instead of reading existed information.
people can stand with own opinion confirmly instead of being attracted by some rumor
so that people can maintain an objective perception

In my opinion, being polite to others is crucial in communication.

This is primarily because being polite is a suitable and easy way to create the desired impression. Good manners cost nothing, but they can make a big difference to how other people feel about you. Politeness can make a person appear more credible because it takes a certain degree of knowledge and experience to demonstrate politeness.

In addition, being polite can often serve to avoid or minimize conflict. People with gentle manners are always aware of and respect others. Consequently, other people are more likely to be polite and courteous in return.

Finally, politeness ensures mutually satisfying interactions. When people are rude, interactions break down and end with annoyance. Politeness develops more enjoyment and satisfaction. We should always strive to be polite.

Some people like to eat out at food stands and restaurants, while others like to prepare food at home. Often it depends on the kind of lifestyle people have. Those with very busy jobs outside the house don’t always have time to cook. They like the convenience of eating out. Overall, though, it is cheaper and healthier to eat at home. While eating in restaurants is fast, the money you spend can add up. When I have dinner at a restaurant with a friend, the bill is usually over twenty dollars. I can buy a lot of groceries with that much money. Even lunch at a fast-food stand usually costs five or six dollars for one person. That’s enough to feed the whole family at home. Eating at home is better for you, too. Meals at restaurants are often high in fat and calories, and they serve big plates of food-much more food-than you need to eat at one meal. If you cook food at home, you have more control over the ingredients. You can use margarine instead of butter on your potatoes, or not put so much cheese on top of your pizza. At home, you can control your portion size. You can serve yourself as little as you want. In a restaurant, you may eat a full plate of food "because you paid for it." It’s true that eating out is convenient. You don’t have to shop, or cook, or clean up. But real home cooking doesn’t have to take up a lot of time. There are lots of simple meals that don’t take long to make. In fact, they’re faster than eating out, especially if you think of the time you spend driving to a restaurant, parking, waiting for a table,, waiting for service, and driving home. Both eating at restaurants and cooking at home can be satisfying. Both can taste good and be enjoyed with family and friends. I prefer cooking at home because of the money and health issues, but people will make the choice that fits their

People attend colleges or universities for a lot of different reasons. I believe that the three most common reasons are to prepare for a career, to have new experiences, and to increase their knowledge of themselves and the world around them.

 Career preparation is becoming more and more important to young people. For many, this is the primary reason to go to college, They know that the job market is competitive. At college, they can learn new skill for careers with a lot of opportunities. This means careers, such as information technology, that are expected to need a large workforce in the coming years. 

Also, students go to colleges and universities to have new experiences. This often means having the opportunity to meet people different from those in their hometowns. For most students,going to college is the first time they've been away from home by themselves. In additions, this is the first time they've had to make decisions on their own. Making these decisions increases their knowledge of themselves.

 Besides looking for self-knowledge, people also attend a university or college to expand their knowledge in subjects they find interesting. For many, this will be their last chance for a long time to learn about something that doesn't relate to their career. 

I would recommend that people not be so focused on a career. They should go to college to have new experiences and learn about themselves and the world they live in
